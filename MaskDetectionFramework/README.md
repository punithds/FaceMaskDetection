# face_mask detection
This model is developed using Kaggle Dataset. Since the model size is big I cannot upload that here.
Instead you can check out my kaggle link https://www.kaggle.com/punithanand/face-mask-detection-pytorch and run the notebook to generate new model for you and get it downloaded.
Define the new path of the model in the notebook and install the following python dependencies to get going,

1.facenet-pytorch
2.pytorch
3.pillow
4.matplotlib
